# GlucoWise - Web App
The GlucoWise Web Application was developed with the idea of creating a User Interface for a GlucoWise Monitoring System that draws real-time data from a sensor Patch measuring Fasting glucose levels, Carbohydrate consumption and more. The GlucoWise mission is to provide accurate, non-invasive, and convenient glucose monitoring solutions that empower underserved communities to take control of their health by replacing traditional glucose monitoring methods which involve the use of lancets and blood samples that can be painful, inconvenient, and disruptive to daily life. By providing non-invasive, accurate, and user-friendly glucose monitoring solutions, GlucoWise aims to empower less priviledged individuals with diabetes to take control of their health. Our devices enable users to make timely and informed decisions to manage their blood sugar levels effectively. With GlucoWise, we strive to improve the quality of life for people living with diabetes and contribute to a healthier future.
